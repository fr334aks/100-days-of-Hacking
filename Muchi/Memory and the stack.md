memory and the stack
a computer stores data In primary(<B>registers</B>,ram,and rom) and secondary memory(hard disk)<br>primary memory are fast but they do not have a large size .Secondary stoages are slower when compared to primary memory 
when it comes to computing data speed,and size or capacity are key issues. 

Important registers 
eax -accumlator register (contains return values and also operations carries our operation values)
Ebp -base frame pointer
ESI source in string /memory operations
ESP -stack pointer
EDI destination in string/ memory operations
EIP instruction pointer
EBX - use to store data and to point to data objects
ECX counter in loops used in loops
EDX points to files and IO objects 

Eflags this register contains a record of the result of operations that were caried out
common flags are 
carry flag -CF used to carry numbers
zero flag -ZF inport to check if you want conditions to take place
PF-
sighn flag -SF
trap flag -TF
Direction flag -Df
Overflow flag -OF 

THE STACK ..
<br>
The stack is a data structure that grows down ward increasing in value
