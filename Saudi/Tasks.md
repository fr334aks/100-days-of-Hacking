## day 1

- Today I worked on Binex room from tryhackme, got to learn about 64-bit buffer overflows and how to exploit them. [link to medium article](https://trevorsaudi.medium.com/binex-tryhackme-c07c3423186e)
- [link to exploit I wrote](./exploits/Binex_64bit.py)

# Resources I used

- [64-bit BOF tutorial](https://medium.com/@buff3r/basic-buffer-overflow-on-64-bit-architecture-3fb74bab3558)



## day 2

- Today I worked on Brainpan room from Tryhackme. Simple buffer overflow to gain a shell on machine.

## day 3

- Brushing up a bit and learning the C prgoramming language. This will be a good stepping stone towards getting good in binary exploitation
- Worked on the OSCP BOF prep room from Tryhackme. Most of these challenges helped me improve on identifying badchars during buffer overflows


## day 4

- Working on 64 bit buffer overflows overflows. Went through introduction to simple stack based BOFs in 64 bit systems, the process layout on machines, x86-64 procedures and endainness

## day 5

- Made progress in learning C programming language. I am using Head First C.
- Went through memory and pointers in C
- Still working on the BoFs room in THM. Went through Overwriting variables and overwriting function pointers

## day 6

- Made more progress in C. Currently learning about string functions in the C library
- Still working on the BoFs room in THM. Performed a 64 bit buffer overflow 

## day 7

- Completed Tryhackme room [link to room](https://tryhackme.com/room/bof1)
- Familiarized myself more with working with gdb, examining the stack and performing 64-bit BOFs

## day 8

- Completed Tryhackme room [link to room](https://tryhackme.com/room/thecodcaper)
- Cod caper features exploiting a 32 bit buffer overflow in linux
- Used pwndbg and pwntools

## day 9

- Started looking into x86 assembly programming
- My github (link)[https://github.com/trevorsaudi/x86asm] to some code I wrote today
