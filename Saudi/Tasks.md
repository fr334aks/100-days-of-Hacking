## day 1

- Today I worked on Binex room from tryhackme, got to learn about 64-bit buffer overflows and how to exploit them. [link to medium article](https://trevorsaudi.medium.com/binex-tryhackme-c07c3423186e)

# Resources I used

- [64-bit BOF tutorial](https://medium.com/@buff3r/basic-buffer-overflow-on-64-bit-architecture-3fb74bab3558)



## day 2

- Today I worked on Brainpan room from Tryhackme. Simple buffer overflow to gain a shell on machine.

## day 3

- Brushing up a bit and learning the C prgoramming language. This will be a good stepping stone towards getting good in binary exploitation
- Worked on the OSCP BOF prep room from Tryhackme. Most of these challenges helped me improve on identifying badchars during buffer overflows


## day 4

- Working on 64 bit buffer overflows overflows.
