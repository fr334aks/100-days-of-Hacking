# 100 Days of Hacking RoadMap
This repo will cointain my journey as i learn x86_64bit Assembly...Some stuff i would like to grasp are:
<p>- Writing x86_64bit Assembly</p>
<p>- Reverse engineer compiled programs</p>
<p>- Pwning</p>
<p>- Hope to finally delve into malware analysis later</p>
<p>- Humble Request: Please look into my journey as i will be learning and advice on new methods and techniques that i could use for various problems and stuff...</p>
<p>- Also suggest more resources you may have that i may use in this journey...Also comment on my code...Thankyouuuu...ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>- Looking forwad to learning...</p>
